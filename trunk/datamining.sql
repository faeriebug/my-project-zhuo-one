Others argue the merger\nwas more cost effective than creating a comparable branch\nnetwork from scratch.\n    The analysts agreed the bank was aggressive. It has\nexpanded overseas, entered the lucrative securities business\nand geared up for domestic competition, but they questioned the\nwisdom of some of those moves.\n    \"They\'ve made bold moves to put everything in place. Now\nit\'s largely out of their hands,\" said Kleinwort Benson Ltd\nfinancial analyst Simon Smithson.\n    Among Sumitomo\'s problems are limits placed on its move to\nenter U.S. Securities business by taking a share in American\ninvestment bank Goldman, Sachs and Co.\n    Sumitomo last August agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5\npct limited partnership in the bank, but for the time being at\nleast, the Federal Reserve Board has forbidden them to exchange\npersonnel, or increase the business they do with each other.\n    \"The tie-up is widely looked on as a lame duck because the\nFed was stricter than Sumitomo expected,\" said one analyst.\n    But Komatsu said the move will pay off in time.\n    \"U.S. Regulations will change in the near future and if so,\nwe can do various things. We only have to wait two or three\nyears, not until the 21st century,\" Komatsu said.\n    Komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routes\ninto the securities business at home.\n    Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act, Japan\'s\nversion of the U.S. Glass-Steagall Act, separates commercial\nfrom investment banking.\n    But the walls between the two are crumbling and Komatsu\nsaid he hopes further deregulation will create new\nopportunities.\n    \"We need to find new business chances,\" Komatsu said. \"In some\ncases these will be securities related, in some cases trust\nbank related. That\'s the kind of deregulation we want.\"\n    Until such changes occur, Sumitomo will focus on such\ndomestic securities business as profitable government bond\ndealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities Co\nLtd, in which it holds a five pct share, Komatsu said.\n    He said Sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about entering\nthe securities business here through its Swiss universal bank\nsubsidiary, Banca del Gottardo.\n     The Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences to\nsecurities subsidiaries of U.S. Commercial banks soon,\nfollowing a similar decision for subsidiaries of European\nuniversal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct.\n    But Komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similar\ndecision on a Gottardo subsidiary.\n    \"We don\'t want to make waves. We expect this will be allowed\nin two or three years,\" he said.\n    Like other city banks, Sumitomo is also pushing to expand\nlending to individuals and small and medium businesses to\nreplace disappearing demand from big business, he added.\n    The analysts said Sumitomo will have to devote a lot of\ntime to digesting its most recent initiatives, including the\nmerger with ailing Heiwa Sogo.\n    \"It\'s (Sumitomo) been bold in its strategies,\" said\nKleinwort\'s Smithson.\n    \"After that, it\'s a question of absorbing and juggling\naround.

Perelman needed the consent because he agreed in\nNovember not to buy stock for 10 years without permission.\n    \"I think Ronald Perelman is less interested in Gillette and\nmore interested in putting Gillette into play because he stands\nto make a ton of money,\" said Andrew Shore, analyst at Shearson\nLehman Brothers Inc. \"In play\" is a term used on Wall Street to\ndescribe what happens when a company becomes an unwiling\ntakeover target.\n    Shore noted that according to the 1986 agreement Revlon\ngets paid if there is any acquisition of Gillette through\nNovember of this year at a price higher than 29.75 dlrs per\nshare.

with the U.S.,\nJapanese and European Community (EC) trade ministers here.\n    Canada, strongly supported by Australia, has championed the\ncause of both developed and developing nations which have seen\ntheir farm trade suffer largely due to a farm subsidy war\nbetween the United States and the EC.\n    Japan\"s protected agricultural markets have also attracted\ncriticism.\n    The issue is of extreme importance to many indebted,\ndeveloping nations which often rely totally on one or two farm\nsector exports to sustain their economies but which cannot\ncompete with the subsidised U.S. And EC products.\n    \"Canada can afford so many billions of dollars (to do so),\nbut many countries cannot,\" said Carney.\n    She said the EC had changed its previous unhelpful attitude\nand had

and\nat the series of discussions on a new world trading framework,\nbegun at Punta del Este, Uruguay, last year.\n    Carney said Japan had also agreed to take a positive role\nin the farm talks, and that the United States was willing to\nsee short-term progress, as long as long-term solutions were\nnot affected.\n    Canada\"s five point programme demands that farm product\nprices must reflect open world market prices, that any support\nfor farmers incomes should not be linked to production\nincentives, that there should be no new farm subsidies, no new\nfarm import barriers, and that any decisions should be\nimplemented collectively.\n    The farm trade problem was almost completely ignored by the\nindustrialised world until Canada raised it last year at the\nTokyo summit of seven

Also,\nDallas-based Uccel had engineered a strong comeback from the\ndark days of 1982, when, as Wyly Corp, it lost 7.7 mln dlrs, or\n56 cts a share.\n   At that time, Wyly owned a potpourri of 13 different\nbusinesses, only three of which were involved in computer\nsoftware.

Therefore,\nhe said he would not change his 1988 earnings estimate of 1.05\ndlrs a share.\n    Wang said he would look closely at the combined operations\nof the two companies and cut duplication in sales, marketing\nand research and development.\n    Analysts said Computer Associates paid a premium for Uccel.\nBased on Friday\'s closing price, the company will swap 47.50\ndlrs worth of its stock for each Uccel share, which is nearly\n33 times Uccel\'s 1987 estimated earnings of 1.45 dlrs a share.\n    Stephen T.

The price gyrations have\ncombined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedented\nvolatility to some U.S. securities markets.\n    At the same time, the SEC is being pressed by some\nlawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporate\ntakeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeovers\nsteadily reshapes the U.S. corporate landscape.\n    And the agency is being pushed by U.S. and foreign\nexchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundwork\nfor an international securities marketplace in which trading\noccurs across borders throughout the world, around the clock.\n    Such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investment\nopportunities but could strain the SEC\'s ability to enforce\nU.S. securities laws and guard investors from fraud.\n    Under the leadership of Shad, the SEC eased financial\ndisclosure requirements for publicly traded companies,\neliminated many minor investor protection rules, attempted to\nspur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agency\'s\nreview of hostile corporate takeovers.\n    Shad, who had been vice chairman of the E.

crude oil, petroleum products,\nchemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters.\n    Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in\n1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State Trading\nCorp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC).\n    \"The two state trading corporations are free to use their\nbuying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian\nexports,\" a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding that\nprivate firms are excluded from countertrading.\n    One trade source said India has targetted countries that\ndepend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign\nimports.\n    However, countertrade deals still make up only a small part\nof India\'s total trading and are likely to account for less\nthan eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in trade\nduring the nine months ended December, the sources said.\n    Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India\'s 25.65\nbillion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March,\nagainst almost nothing in 1984/85, official figures show.\n    However, the figures exclude exchanges with the Eastern\nBloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees, the sources

billion in 1985/86.\n    Indian countertrade, which is being promoted mainly to help\nnarrow the country\'s large trade deficit, is still\ninsignificant compared with agreements reached by Indonesia,\nVenezuela and Brazil, the trade sources said.\n    The trade deficit, which hit an estimated record 6.96\nbillion dlrs in 1985/86, is expected to decline to 5.6 billion\nin the current fiscal year.\n    But the push to include non-communist countries in\ncountertrade is also due to other factors, including the slow\ngrowth of foreign reserves, a tight debt repayment schedule,\nshrinking aid and trade protectionism, businessmen said.\n    One source said India is showing more dynamism in promoting\ncountertrade deals than in the past, when the deals were made\ndiscreetly because they break GATT rules.

Last year,\nthe average dealership had 11.2 mln dlrs in sales--a 15-fold\nincrease from 1956--and employed 34 workers.\n    \"I had one of these guys tell me he makes six, seven mln\ndlrs a year and didn\'t know what to do with all his money,\"\nsays Cole.\n    \"There\'s a whole lot more rich guys who sell cars than that\nmake cars,\" he says.\n    With the increase in size, large dealers have been buying\nup other dealerships, and auto analysts see few signs the trend\nwill let up.\n    Donald Keithley, vice president, dealer services, for J.D.\nPower, a California-based market research firm, says that, by\n1990, 12,000 people will own dealerships compared to 16,800\nprincipal owners today.\n    Many dealers are experimenting with owning several\nfranchises, some of which might compete against each other. \"It\nused to be a Chevrolet dealer was a Chevrolet dealer. Now a\nChevrolet dealer might handle several lines,\" Jauppi says.\n    As dealers get bigger, industry officials are talking about\nthe possibility that some of them might become publicly-owned\nor open international operations.\n    Offering shares to the public is an option large dealers,\n\"are obviously thinking of very seriously,\" says Cole.\n    Although some say the franchise system might get in the way\nof a public offering, Jauppi says there are few obstacles to\ntrading in car dealer shares.\n    \"Dealers are large enough now to go public. The only thing\nthe manufacturer cares about is that the dealer sells those\ncars. It could happen any time,\" Jauppi says.\n    \"If you look at the whole merger mania, and look at the\nscale some of these dealers, it\'s going to be very hard to\nresist taking them public,\" said another analyst.\n    And Jauppi says that dealerships can be expected to become\ninternational.\n    \"We\'re going to have international dealers--dealer networks\nthat are worldwide,\" he says. U.S. dealers will be attracted\nparticularly to Europe, where the market will expand faster\nthan the U.S., he says.\n    \"It\'s not totally off the wall,\" says Cole.\n Reuter\n'),(321,'acq','NISSAN AFFILIATE TO ACQUIRE U.S. AUTOPARTS MAKER','<Kokusan Kinzoku Kogyo Co Ltd> (KKK), a\nJapanese autoparts maker owned 25 pct by Nissan Motor Co Ltd\n<NSAN.T>, has exchanged a memorandum to acquire over 50 pct of\nU.S. Autoparts firm <Master-Cast Co> to avoid losses on U.S.\nSales caused by the yen\'s rise against the dollar, a KKK\nspokesman said.\n    The final agreement should be signed this year when KKK\nforms the new company <Alfa K Technology>, he said.\n    The new firm should supply all the U.S. Major car makers,\nincluding Ford Motor Co <F>, General Motor Corp <GM> and\nChrysler Corp <C>, he said.\n REUTER\n'),(322,'acq',' BRUSSELS - Ferruzzi says it will pay 630 mln dlrs to CPC International for European mills.\n',''),(323,'acq','FERRUZZI DEAL WITH CPC WORTH 630 MLN DLRS','The Ferruzzi Group\'s holding company\nAgricola Finanziara SpA will pay 630 mln dlrs for the European\ncorn wet milling business of CPC International Inc under the\nagreement reached in principle between the two companies, a\nstatement by Ferruzzi released by its Brussels office said.\n    When CPC announced the agreement yesterday in New York, it\nsaid only that the price would be in excess of 600 mln dlrs.\n    Ferruzzi said the deal is subject to agreement on several\nclauses of the contract and needs government authorisations.\n    It said the deal would involve 13 starch factories\nemploying about 5,000 people in eight European Community\ncountries plus facilities and commercial operations in other EC\nstates.\n    The factories have a capacity to produce the equivalent of\n1.6 mln tonnes of starch in starch and by-products a year, or\nabout one third of EC production, from about 2.7 mln tonnes of\ncereals.\n    Ferruzzi said the acquisition of these assets would extend\nits presence in the European agro-industrial industry both\ngeographically and in terms of products.\n    It said it is already the principal EC producer of sugar\nand of soya oil and cake, and the major cereal trader.\n    It noted that EC output of isoglucose is subject to maximum\nquotas, of which CPC currently holds a 25 pct share, and said\nit foresaw an increase in other industrial uses of starch in\nthe future, notably in the production of ethanol for fuel.\n    Raul Gardini, president of the Ferruzzi Group, said the\npresent management of the CPC milling business will be asked to\nremain in their posts.\n REUTER\n'),(324,'acq','GUINNESS SEEKS U.K. INJUNCTION AGAINST SAUNDERS','Guinness Plc <GUIN.L> will seek an\ninjunction in the U.K. High Court today to freeze the assets of\nformer Chairman Ernest Saunders in its attempts to recover 5.2\nmln stg paid to a Jersey company as part of the company\'s\ntakeover battle for <Distillers Co Plc>, a spokesman said.\n    He said the court move aimed to freeze Saunders\' assets up\nto the value of the sum it wanted to recover.

The one mln tonne upward revision in\n1986/87 wheat production reflects several minor adjustments.\nThe IWC raised the 1986/87 coarse grain trade figure two mln to\n87 mln tonnes. It left wheat trade unchanged at 86 mln.\n    The IWC 1986/87 estimate for world trade in wheat and\ncoarse grain is thus estimated two mln tonnes higher at 173 mln\nagainst 169 mln the previous season with the forecast three mln\nrise in Soviet imports offset by small reductions elsewhere.\n    The IWC said the area harvested for wheat in 1987/88 is\nlikely to be down from last year as low world prices and\nrestrictive national policies measures begin to take effect.\n    At least four of the five major exporters expect to see a\ndrop in wheat sowings without offset in other countries. There\nis still potential for even higher average wheat yields but the\nIWC said there are increasing signs world output may level off.\n    Although it is still early to assess the coarse grain\noutlook, the IWC said barley acreage is likely to fall in the\nEuropean Community but increase in Canada. U.S. Maize area is\nexpected lower but oat sowings could rise.\n    After damage to its maize crop last year, the Soviet Union\nplans to expand this area by as much as 50 pct to over six mln\nhectares in a year when many frost damaged wheat fields are\nlikely to be resown to this and other spring crops. Improved\nweather and a further increase in the use of intensive\ncultivation methods could therefore see a marked rise in Soviet\nmaize output in 1987, the IWC said.\n    Any reduction in world coarse grain output would be\nbolstered by the large carryover stocks from 1986/87, the IWC\nsaid.\n    It left its estimates of wheat and coarse grain stocks at\nendof different marketing years unchanged at 178 and 210 mln\ntonnes, respectively, against 160 and 167 mln a year earlier.\n    After record world durum wheat production of 218.8 mln\ntonnes last season, the IWC said there are already signs of\nanother large crop this coming season with higher output\nexpected in the EC, Canada, the U.S. And North Africa.\n REUTER\n'),(399,'grainwheat','IWC SAYS EFFECT OF LOWER SUPPORT PRICES LIMITED','Efforts by governments to control wheat\nsurpluses by cutting support prices have met with only partial\nsuccess, the International Wheat Council (IWC) says in its\nlatest monthly report.\n    Faster results could be achieved by a policy of reducing\nboth price and areas, as employed in the United States, the IWC\nsays in a survey of support prices in the five main wheat\nexporters - Argentina, Australia, Canada, the EC and the U.S.\n    In some countries, for example Australia and Argentina,\nwhich are highly dependent on wheat shipments for export\nincome, there may be problems in reducing production.\n    A policy of cutting wheat production could lead to\nunemployment, with job prospects outside agriculture limited.\nAlternative crops may offer inferior returns which could then\nlead to lost export revenue and balance of payments problems.\n    The IWC outlines three courses of action open to\ngovernments in wheat exporting countries.\n    They could continue to support prices in the hope that when\nthe world economy improves demand for wheat will rise and\nsurpluses wil be reduced or eliminated.\n    Alternatively, support could be limited to wheat which\ncould be easily sold, without needing to be stored for a long\nperiod.\n    This option may prove to be the most politically\nunattractive and would result in many producers abandoning\nwheat production, the report said.\n    The third option would be for governments to distinguish\nbetween the commercial and social aspects of agriculture,\npossibly varying support prices according to farm size or\noverall production.\n    The IWC review covers support prices in the major exporting\ncountries since 1982. At some time during that period all the\nproducers cut support prices in response to growing surpluses.\n    These changes did not always result in lower export\nsubsidies as on several occasions currency fluctuations more\nthan offset lower prices in the domestic currency.\n    For example between 1985/86 and 1986/87 the EC intervention\nprice for bread wheat fell from 209.30 to 179.44 European\ncurrency units (Ecus). It dollar terms, the currency in which\nmost export transactions are denominated, the intervention\nprice however rose to 193 dlrs from 168. The high cost of\nsupporting farm prices has put a strain on national exchequers\nand some governments are now searching for ways to cut\nexpenditure, the report says.\n    The proportion of world wheat output produced by the five\nmajor exporters declined in the period covered by the survey\nfrom 40 pct in 1982 to 35 pct in 1987. This was partly due to\nincreased production in China and India.\n    The period saw an upward trend in yields, although this was\ncountered in the Argentina, the U.S. And Australia by lower\nacreages.\n    In Argentina a reduction in the sown area of about 20 per\ncent was put down to low prices causing producers to switch to\nother enterprises, particularly livestock while lower U.S.\nAcreages are attributed to official incentives.\n REUTER\n'),(400,'acq','MICKELBERRY <MBC> COMPLETES SALE OF UNIT','Mickelberry Corp said it has completed\nthe previously-announced sale of the 51 pct of its C and W\nGroup subsidiary that it had retained to N W Ayer Inc for\nundisclosed terms.\n    Ayer bought the other 49 pct next year.\n    Mickelberry said it will report a gain on the transaction.\n Reuter\n'),(401,'acq','PHILIPS ELECTRICAL SELLS STAKE IN UNIDARE','<Philips Electrical (Ireland) Ltd> has\narranged the sale of the one mln ordinary shares it holds in\nits subsidiary <Unidare Aluminium Ltd>, Unidare said.\n    The placing has been arranged through <Allied Irish\nInvestment Bank Plc> at an ex-dividend price of 371 Irish pence\nper share.\n REUTER\n'),(402,'acq','FOOTE MINERAL CO IN LETTER OF INTENT TO MERGE INTO RIO TINTO-ZINC\n',''),(403,'acq','FOOTE MINERAL <FTE> TO MERGE INTO RIO TINTO','Foote Mineral Co said it has signed\na letter of intent to merge into <Rio Tinto-Zinc Corp PLC> for\ncash.\n    The company said at the time of the acquisition, its assets\nwill include only lithium and ferrosilicon operations.

possible.\"\n    In 1991 federal regulatory changes will allow the major\nEast Coast banks to buy banks in California.\n    First Interstate, the fourth largest California bank, and\nthe nineth largest nationwide, owns 24 banks in 12 western\nstates and has franchise operations in four additional states.\n    Bank industry sources say it is an attractive target for\nlarge U.S. or foreign banks, looking to quickly move into the \nlucrative California market and the West Coast region.\n    While declining specifics on his corporate strategy, when\nasked if acquisitions will be part of the plan, Pinola replied,\n\"That\'s undoubtedly a fair statement...it would be almost naive\nnot to think that.\"\n    Pinola characterized his acquisition strategy as\n\"opportunistic\".\n    He said he will look for banks in management trouble that\nhe can get at a bargain, then add management to restore\nprofitability, or for banks in states where First Interstate\nalready operates, then cut costs by combining resources.\n    The exception, he said, would be Texas, where he said most\nof the banks are already well managed, but might be purchased\nat a discount because of the depressed regional economy.\n    Pinola declined comment on what circumstances might move\nhim to rekindle his bid for BankAmerica, saying only, \"We\ncontinue to monitor and look at a lot of things and a lot of\npeople continue to monitor and look at us.\"\n    Banking analysts, however, consider another First\nInterstate bid at BankAmerica a long shot, not likely to happen\nany time soon.\n    Pinola called his decision last month to withdraw his 3.25\nbillion dlr bid at the nation\'s second largest bank, \"a very,\nvery difficult decision.\"\n    With that decision made, however, he acknowledged First\nInterstate may now have a difficult time keeping its number\nfour position in the California banking community.\n    \"The competition in this state is tough,\" he said, noting\nCityBank\'s

dominated.\n    \"Security is, has been and continues to be a highly\nprofitable and obviously well managed company,\" he said.\n    He added, however, First Interstate, at the moment, has the\nadvantages of having owned and managed regional banks longer\nand has the recognition advantage of having given its regional\nbanks a common name.\n    Pinola said while its coastal state banks are in good\nfinancial condition, First Interstate continues to sustain\nserious loan losses in its Rocky Mountain states, where energy,\nreal estate and agriculture dominate the economy.\n    Asked if he thought loan losses in those areas had peaked,\nhe said, \"I don\'t think it has bottomed out, because I think\nmost of the problems are real estate-related and the real\nestate problems are

Interstate has 42 franchise banks that offer First\nInterstate financial services in ten states.\n    While a year ago he was considering taking his franchise\noperation east of the Mississippi River,

An aide to Glickman\nsaid that it will probably be introduced next week.\n    Glickman said a 0/92 program, which allows a farmer to\nforego planting and still receive 92 pct of his deficiency\npayment, would not be a major revision of the 1985 farm bill --\nonly an extension of the 50/92 option already provided under\nthe current bill.\n    It is premature to make any major changes in the farm bill,\nhe said, but if agriculture has to make further cuts to meet\nbudget goals, a voluntary 0/92 plan would be better than\nsharply cutting target prices, as USDA has proposed.\n    A 0/92 plan, however, would not be decoupling, but simply a\ndifferent type of acreage diversion program, Glickman said.\n    Decoupling -- delinking planting decisions from government\npayments -- is too much of a policy change to approve at this\npoint, he said.\n    \"I don\'t think there is any interest in pursuing a\ndecoupling bill this year. Period. Unequivocal,\" Glickman said\nat the hearing.\n    Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.), cosponsor of the\nBoren/Boschwitz decoupling plan, said he supports a short term\n0/92 program as a move to a more permament decoupling plan.\n    Boschwitz plans to introduce a 0/92 plan in the senate. His\nplan would guarantee a certain deficiency payment to\nparticipating farmers, require that idled acreage be put to\nconservation use only, prohibit haying and grazing on extra\nidled acreage, limit participation to a certain number of acres\nin a county and provide tenant protection provisions.\n    \"I know we cannot obtain complete decoupling in 1987, but\nwe can at least move in that direction,\" Boschwitz said.\n    Robbin Johnson, vice president of Cargill, Inc., testified\nin favor of decoupling. Decoupling would end the current bias\nin U.S. farm policy towards overproduction and reduce farmers\'\ndependency on the government, he said.\n    A 0/92 plan does not go far enough in decoupling, Johnson\nsaid, and would still encourage farmers to plant.\n    Officials from the National Corn Growers Association and\nthe National Cattlemen\'s Association said their groups oppose\nany 0/92 or decoupling plan due to concerns about reopening the\nfarm bill and creating more confusion among farmers.\n    But when asked if his association were forced to choose\nbetween a ten pct cut in target prices or a 0/92 program, Larry\nJohnson of the Corn Growers said they would agree to 0/92\nrather than take sharp cuts in target levels.\n Reuter\n'),(603,'acq','SAFEGUARD SCIENTIFIC <SFE> IN EQUITY DEAL','Safeguard Scientifics Inc\nsaid it made a 2.5 mln dlr equity investment in <Sanchez\nComputer Associates Inc>, a private computer software firm\nbased in Malvern, Pa.\n   Safeguard said the investment gives it a \"major ownership\nposition\" in Sanchez, which specializes in software products\nfor financial institutions.\n Reuter\n'),(604,'acq','<SUMMIT PETROLEUM CORP> SELLS SHARES','Summit Petroleum Corp said it\nsold 11.3 mln shares, or 29.4 pct, of its common stock to\n<Halbert and Associates Inc>.\n    The company said the shares were previously held by\n<Consolidated Energy Corp> and Harken Oil and Gas Inc <HOGI>.\n    In addition, David D.

Japan\'s rice PSE was 68.8 pct compared to the EC\n13.6 and the U.S. 5.4 pct, the OECD calculations show.\n    In coarse grains, Japan\'s subsidies reached 107.1 pct\ncompared with 27.9 pct for the EC and 13.1 pct for the U.S.\nJapan\'s beef subsidy was 54.9 pct versus 52.7 pct for the EC\nand 9.5 pct for the U.S., OECD concluded.\n    For sugar, Japan\'s PSE was 48.4 pct versus 27.9 pct in the\nEC and 13.1 pct for the U.S., the study shows.\n    The OECD calculated farm subsidies for other industrial\ncountries such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand but in most\ncases the results were much lower than for the U.S., EC and\nJapan, the sources said.\n    Subsidies in Argentina and Brazil, two major developing\ncountry producers of commodities, were not included in the OECD\nwork.\n    Officials said they hope to persuade reluctant countries to\nrelease the study soon, perhaps coinciding with the OECD\nministerial meeting in Paris during May.\n    Some officials hope the OECD results will be used as a \nbasis for negotiations during the Uruguay round of global trade\ntalks now underway in Geneva.\n    British Agriculture Minister Michael Jopling during a visit\nto Washington this week endorsed the OECD work as a starting\npoint for the Uruguay round negotiations on agriculture.\n    He said the PSE calculations provide a tool to negotiate\ndown domestic farm support levels, which are a major cause of\nthe present crisis in world agriculture.\n    However, the OECD study results are controversial because\nthey highlight the levels of assistance to farmers, officials\nfamiliar with the study said.\n    The U.S. Agriculture Department\'s Economic Research Service\nrecently published a study of farm subsidies in an attempt to\nverify the OECD results and update them to 1982-84.\n    In some cases the results were substantially different than\nthe OECD\'s, in part because farm policies in both the U.S. and\nelsewhere had changed markedly by 1982-84 from the OECD base\nperiod of 1979-81, U.S. officials said.\n    For example, the USDA study found the United States\nsubsidies to corn producers were higher in 1982-84, at 25 to 49\npct, than in the EC, at zero to nine pct.\n    French Maize Producers Association president Marcel Cazale,\nciting the result of the USDA calculation for corn, told\nreporters last week that the United States subsidizes its\nfarmers more than the EC.\n    However, the sources said EC corn subsidies are probably\nhigher than the U.S. now because of increases since 1984.\n    Officials of several countries have been asked to\ncontribute data to OECD so that the study can be updated to\n1985 subsidy levels, a much more relevant measure of the\ncurrent world farm situation.\n    The updated calculations, which may take several months to\ncomplete, are expected to show substantial increases in U.S.\nsubsidy levels for sugar because the U.S. imposed restrictive\nimport quotas in 1982 as aid to the domestic industry.\n    U.S. subsidy levels also are increased by the 1985 farm\nbill, which sharply boosted government deficiency payments to\ngrain farmers and applied a marketing loan for rice,

The bill would allow farmers to forego planting and\nstill receive 92 pct of deficiency payments.\n    The administration has strongly urged that the bill be\nexpanded to feedgrains and to more than one year.\n    It is difficult to tell in what form the 0/92 provision\nwill emerge from the committee, the sources said.\n    Proponents of an expansion of 0/92 maintain there are large\nestimated cost savings of such a bill -- ranging from estimates\nby the administration of 200 to 500 mln dlrs.\n    Opposition to a reopening of the 1985 farm bill at this\ntime is the major reason cited by those against an expansion of\nthe bill, committee staffers said.\n    The 0/92 plan is scheduled to be discussed at 1530 EST. A\nconflicting floor vote delayed the start of the meeting, and\nstaffers said it may have to be delayed even until next week.\n    Such a delay would not bode well for proponents of an\nexpanded 0/92 program, since spring planting in many areas of\nthe country will be underway in the next few weeks and signup\nfor the 1987 wheat and feedgrains program ends March 30.\n    Farmers are now making their planting decisions, so\nsomething has to be done quickly if a 0/92 program is to be\nimplemented, an Agriculture Department source said.\n    An expansion of 0/92 to feedgrains was opposed in last\nweek\'s subcommittee hearing on the bill, with subcommittee\nchairman Dan Glickman, D-Kan., saying that more study of the\nconsequences of decoupling on feedgrains plantings was\nnecessary.\n    Major commodity groups, including the National Corn\nGrowers, the American Farm Bureau and the National Cattlemen\'s\nAssociation, have voiced strong opposition to 0/92.\n    But proponents of an expanded 0/92 argue that the bill\ncurrently is not equitable for all grains producers, so it\nshould be extended to other crops.\n    There will be difficulty in limiting 0/92 to wheat, said\nGene Moos, aide to house majority leader Tom Foley, D-Wash.\n    Projected cost savings, in the current atmosphere of try to\ndecrease farm expenditures, would also be hard to ignore in the\ndebate to expand the 0/92 application, Moos said.\n    Rep.

The move complicated a USAir\ntakeover offer for Piedmont, which was believed to be close to\naccepting the bid.\n    Today, USAir rejected Icahn\'s 52 dlr per share offer and\nsaid the bid was a last-minute effort to interfere in its\ntakeover of Piedmont.

USAir fell 1-3/8 to 47-3/4 as doubt spread\nit would be taken over.\n    Analysts and market sources view the TWA bid as an attempt\nto either trigger a counter offer from USAir or to attract a\nsuitor who might want both airlines once they merged.\n   \"The next move is either Icahn starts a tender offer or\nPiedmont and USAir announce a deal,\" speculated one arbitrager.\n    Some arbitragers said there is now some risk in the current\nprice of Piedmont since it is not clear that USAir\'s bid will\nsucceed.\n    Piedmont\'s largest shareholder and other suitor, Norfolk\nSouthern Corp <NSC> has offered 65 dlrs per share for the\ncompany. USAir offered 71 dlrs cash per share for half of\nPiedmont stock, and 73 dlrs per share in stock for the balance.\n    Some arbitragers, however, believe the depressed price of\nPiedmont offers a buying opportunity since the airline is\ndestined to be acquired by someone. USAir, they said, is the\nleast likely to be bought.\n    Icahn, who has long talked about further consolidation in\nthe airline industry, also offered USAir the alternative of a\nthree-way airline combination, including TWA and Piedmont.\n    But Wall Street has given little credibility to Icahn\'s\noffer, which lacked financing and was riddled with\ncontingencies.\n    Still, he has succeeded in holding up a merger of two\nairlines - both of which analysts said would fit well with TWA.\n    \"You can\'t discount him,\" said one arbitrager.\n    Analysts, however, said Icahn would have to prove he is\nserious by following through with his threats or making a new\noffer. In making the offer for USAir, Icahn threatened to go\ndirectly to shareholders for 51 pct of the stock at a lower\nprice if USAir rejected his offer.\n    \"It\'s clear Icahn wants to sell and he\'s bluffing,\" said\none arbitrager.\n    Analysts said the 52 dlr per share offer was underpriced by\nabout six dlrs per share.\n    Some analysts believe Icahn\'s proposed three-way airline\ncombination might face insurmountable regulatory hurdles, but\nothers believe it could be cleared if the companies are\nacquired separately.\n    \"TWA would have to be the surviving company for the deal to\nwork,\" said one analyst.\n    Analysts said such a merger would be costly and\ncomplicated. TWA has the best cost structure, since Icahn\nsucceeded in winning concessions from its unions.\n    In order for the other carriers to come down to TWA\'s wage\nscale in a merger, TWA would have to be the surviving entity,\nanalysts said.\n    Such a move does not necessarily free Icahn of TWA, they\nsaid. They said he showed skill in reducing Ozark Airlines\'\ncosts when he merged it into TWA last year, and he might be a\nnecessary ingredient for a merger to work.\n    However, other analysts speculated the managements of\nPiedmont and USAir would not tolerate Icahn as head of a new\ncompany.

It imposed daily and weekly purchase\nlimits, prohibited the BSM from operating on futures markets\nand stipulated, after consumer insistence, that up to 15 pct of\ntotal buffer stock purchases could be of non-member cocoa. This\nwill help prevent lower quality cocoa from Malaysia, the\nworld\'s fourth largest producer, undermining the market.\n    The cocoa pact establishes precise differentials the Buffer\nStock Manager must use when purchasing varying grades.\n    A new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA) was\nadopted earlier this month in Geneva. Importing and exporting\ncountries agreed several changes to make the reference price\nmore responsive to market trends and they eliminated provisions\nunder which the buffer stock could borrow from banks to finance\noperations. Direct cash contributions from members will fund\nbuffer stock purchases. Bank financing was a particular feature\nof the failed ITC buffer stock which suffered losses running\ninto hundreds of millions of sterling. Legal wrangles continue.\n    Recent International Coffee Organization (ICO) negotiations\nin London exemplified the degree to which consumers insist that\nagreements reflect market reality, commodity analysts said.\n    Consumers and a small group of producers argued that\n\"objective criteria\" should be used to define export quota\nshares, which would have meant a reduction in the share of\nBrazil, the world\'s leading producer. Brazil wanted to maintain\nits previous quota share of 30 pct. The talks broke down and,\nalthough an ICO executive board meeting starts in London today,\ndelegates and trade sources see chances of any near term\nnegotiations on export quota distribution as remote.\n    International agreements exist for sugar and wheat. These\ndo not have any economic clauses but provide a forum for\ndiscussions on possible future economic agreements, collect\nstatistics and draw up market analyses. Analysts said\ndifferences between sugar exporting countries have held up any\nprogress towards an accord with economic teeth, while sheer\ncompetition between major exporters amid a world grain glut\nmilitate against any pact with economic provisions for wheat.\n    An alternative focus for commodity discussions are\ninternational study groups, made up of governments with advice\nfrom industry, such as those for lead and zinc and rubber.\n    The U.N. Common fund for commodities, with a planned\ndirectly contributed capital of 470 mln dlrs, has failed to\nbecome operational because neither the U.S. Nor the Soviet\nUnion has ratified it. U.S. Officials in Washington said the\nU.S. Doubts the fund would be able to fulfil its objectives,\nciting the lack of widespread support.\n    U.S. Officials in Washington and Malaysian officials in\nKuala Lumpur expressed a policy of looking at each commodity\npact case by case. U.S. Officials said it has been willing to\nstudy individual cases for economically sound, market-oriented\ncommodity accords balancing producer and consumer interests.\n    \"We see little to be gained by attempting to increase the\nprice of a commodity whose long-term trend is downward,\"\nofficial Administration policy states. The U.S. Currently\nbelongs to only two international commodity agreements that\nhave economic clauses - the International Coffee Agreement\n(ICA) and INRA - but it is also a member of the sugar and wheat\npacts.\n    The U.S. Did not join the International Cocoa Agreement\nbecause it considered its proposed price ranges unrealistic and\nnot designed to protect the interests of consuming countries,\nthe State Department said. U.S. Officials singled out the INRA\nas the one commodity agreement that seems to be working.\n    U.S. Negotiators were successful in getting other members\nof the pact to agree that the price review and adjustment\nmechanism of the rubber agreement would accurately reflect\nmarket trends and also to continue the accord as a market\noriented agreement, U.S. Officials said.\n    Canadian officials in Ottawa also said they have\nconsistently tried to look at membership of commodity pacts on\nthe merits of each case. Malaysian Primary Industries Minister\nLim Keng Yaik told Reuters in Kuala Lumpur his country, the\nworld\'s top producer of rubber, tin and palm oil, decides its\nparticipation in international commodity pacts case by case.\n    Malaysia is a member of the Association of Tin Producing\nCountries (ATPC) which produce 65 pct of world tin. The ATPC\nlaunched a plan to limit member tin exports to 96,000 tonnes\nfor a year from March to cut the tin surplus to 50,000 from\n70,000.\n    Economist in the West German Ministry of Agriculture and\ndelegate to cocoa, wheat and sugar agreements Peter Baron told\nReuters in London, \"Agreements with economic clauses to\nstabilise prices could function if fixed price ranges were\nclose to market reality, if there was full participation by\nproducers and consumers, and if participants were prepared to\ntake their obligations in the framework of the agreement\nseriously.\"\n    But Baron added, \"No real sanctions are available for a\ncountry that doesn\'t stick to its obligations...The German\napproach is sceptical. We don\'t think agreements are the best\ninstrument to help developing countries. They were never meant\nto be a vehicle for the transfer of resources and that is how\ndeveloping countries often interpret them.\"\n    Traditionally Britain has always been supportive of\ncommodity agreements, reflecting its strong links with Third\nWorld producing countries. But recently demands for more\nstringent and justifiable pacts with emphasis placed on the\nneed for \"intellectual honesty\" and \"objective criteria\" have\ngrown.\n    British officials stress the need for commodity pacts to be\na two way partnership in trade rather than a disguise for aid.\n    It is now seen as essential that any pacts involving direct\nmarket participation through a buffer stock have a high degree\nof transparency and do not contain the risk of open-ended\nborrowing that occurred in the tin pact, they said. U.K.\nDelegates talk of stabilisation and the need for prices to\nreflect changes in market structure and price trends rather\nthan dictate what prices should be.\n    A Foreign Ministry official in Tokyo said Japan urges price\nrealism in commodity pacts, adding high prices inflate supply.\n    A government spokesman in Paris said France is favourable\nto commodity pacts. France, a large consumer and producer of\nsugar, favours a sugar pact as long as it reflects the real\nmarket situation, particularly regarding stocks.\n    Indonesia\'s Foreign Minister Mochtar Kusumaatmadja told\nReuters in Jakarta: \"These agreements can work as long as the\nproblems are cyclical..But it\'s another matter when there are\nstructural problems..But we are still committed to commodity\nagreements as an act of faith.\" Nicaraguan External Trade\nMinister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca said in London producers\ncannot afford not to give their backing to commodity\nagreements.\n    \"The political will is not there on the part of some\nconsumers to make agreements work,\" Martinez Cuenca said.\n    The head of the economics department in the Brazilian\nForeign Ministry, Sebastiao do Rego Barros, told Reuters an\nagreement can be successful if it keeps a link with market\nreality.

The speculation pushed Borg-Warner\'s\nstock up 1-3/8 to 48-1/2 in heavy trading.\n    Analysts predicted feisty GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman will\nstage a tough campaign to gain control of Borg-Warner so he can\nadd its profitable plastics and chemical business to GAF.\n    \"It seems from at least their dealing with (raider Irwin)\nJacobs that they don\'t want to be taken over. The question is\nnow do they acquiesce to GAF. I think instinctively, they want\nto remain independent,\" said Dudley Heer of Duff and Phelps.\n    Borg-Warner has been under siege by takeover speculation\nfor almost a year. Last week, Jacobs\' investment vehicle,\nMinstar Inc, and an investor group sold its 10.1 mln\nBorg-Warner shares. The same day, GAF Corp raised its stake by\n9.1 mln shares to 19.9 pct of the outstanding.\n    Jacobs was interested in buying the company, but took no\nsteps toward a transaction.\n    \"Their (Borg-Warner) policy has been to stonewall them for\nthe last nine months. It\'s been one of the dullest corporate\nbattles I\'ve seen,\" said one analyst.\n    The battle, however, has heated up, and the range of\nbreakup values on Wall Street span from the current market\nprice to almost 60 dlrs per share. Most analysts said they\nthink a price in the low 50s would be appropriate.\n    Arbitragers speculate that GAF will not give up easily on\nits 3.16 billion dlr offer to buy the balance of Borg-Warner.\n    Analysts who know GAF predict Heyman will either end up\nwith Borg-Warner or enrich his chemicals and building materials\ncompany in some other way. Heyman two years ago attempted an\nunsuccessful takeover of Union Carbide Corp, but GAF benefited\nfrom that company\'s restructuring.\n    \"Borg Warner can\'t quibble that it\'s not a legitimate\noffer. It seems to me the short of it is Borg Warner is kind of\nbetween a rock and a hard place. They either have to accept a\n46 dlr proposal or perhaps work a deal where it\'s sweetened. I\npersonally think the company is (worth) around 55 dlrs per\nshare,\" said Pershing analyst Richard Henderson.\n    Henderson also speculated the company might attempt a\nrestructuring such as the one carried out by Goodyear Tire and\nRubber Co last year when it was being courted by Sir James\nGoldsmith. The company bought back the financier\'s stock and\ncarried out a wider share repurchase.\n    Arbitragers, however, said they do not believe Heyman is\nseeking \"greenmail,\" or the repurchase of his stock by the\ncompany at a premium.\n    Analysts noted that Heyman seems to have no problems with\nfinancing the transaction.\n    Previously associated with \"junk bond\" experts, Drexel\nBurnham Lambert Inc, GAf said it would finance its Borg-Warner\ntakeover with bank financing. GAF said it would make a tender\noffer following a merger agreement approved by the Borg-WArner\nboard and conditioned on the board\'s recommendation of the\ntender offer and merger.\n    Heyman said in a letter to Borg-Warner that he expects a\nmerger would provide job security for Borg-Warner employees\nsince the two companies businesses overlap. Analysts, however,\nbelieve Heyman would sell off assets he did not want to repay\ndebt from the transaction.\n    GAF\'s stock rose 1-5/8 today, to 48-5/8.\n   \"I believe, obviously, if GAF takes over Borg-Warner at the\nlevel it is proposing it would enhance GAF share values\nsubstantially,\" said Oppenheimer analyst Charles Rose.\n    He said at 46 dlrs per share, Heyman\'s average cost for the\ncompany\'s stock would be 44 dlrs per share based on GAF\'s\ncurrent holdings.\n    Rose said the Borg-Warner plastics and chemical business,\nwhich makes thermo-plastics is the asset attracting Heyman.\nAnalysts said it accounts for a third of Borg\'s earnings.\n    The plastics are used in telephone equipment, office\nequipment and appliances. \"Borg has half the market in the U.S.\nand is the leading technical player and the leading innovator,\"\nRose said. Its competitors are Dow Chemical Co <DOW> and\nMonsanto Corp <MTC>, he said.\n    Borg-Warner also has an automotive parts business, and a\nprotective systems business, which includes Wells Fargo\nsecurity guards. It also has an information services business,\nand is trying to sell its financial services business.\n    Borg-Warner earned 206.1 mln dlrs or 2.35 dlrs per share on\nrevenues of 3.62 billion dlrs in 1986.

cautious in their efforts to acquire U.S. High\ntechnology firms but will not halt such attempts, industry\nanalysts said.\n    The collapse of the deal will not be a critical blow to\nFujitsu but it will boost the cost of future U.S. Expansion by\nthe Japanese firm, said analysts polled by Reuters.\n    \"The acquisition of Fairchild is not essential to Fujitsu\'s\nNorth American operations, but it would have been a great\nboost,\" James Capel and Co analyst Tom Murtha said.\n    French-controlled Schlumberger said yesterday it was ending\nthe agreement because mounting political controversy in the\nU.S. Made it unlikely that the sale of the Fairchild stake\ncould be completed in a reasonable time.\n    The sale was opposed by the U.S. Commerce Department and\nDefence Department, partly on national security grounds.\n    Fujitsu\'s acquisition of Fairchild would have given the\nJapanese computer maker control of a comprehensive North\nAmerican sales and distribution system and access to\nmicroprocessor technology, an area where Fujitsu is weak,\nanalysts said.\n    The deal would also have given Fujitsu 14 additional\nmicrochip production facilities worldwide, eight of them in the\nU.S., A report by the Capel firm said.\n    \"It was an entry point, a port for semiconductors and a\nmarketing channel for other things,\" said Barclays de Zoete Wedd\nanalyst Rick May.\n    Several analysts said the purchase would not have given\nFujitsu access to critical defence technology.\n    \"(Fairchild) simply doesn\'t have key technology -- that\'s a\nthing of the past,\" May said.\n    The failure could be a blessing in disguise for Fujitsu as\nit might have had to spend several hundred million dollars to\nmodernise Fairchild\'s production lines, Capel\'s Murtha said.\n    The failure of the deal will doubtless encourage Japanese\nfirms to take a lower profile in attempts to acquire U.S. High\ntech firms but they are unlikely to stop, analysts said.\n    Most analysts said Fujitsu was likely to go the more costly\nroute of expanding its own production and distribution\nfacilities in the U.S., Although some said it could use the\nestimated 200 mln dlrs set aside for buying Fairchild to try to\nacquire some less politically symbolic firm.\n    \"It may slow the pace of Japanese acquisitions, but the\nnecessity of expanding their production and design capacity in\nAmerica remains,\" said Capel\'s Murtha. \"The Japanese will\ncontinue to shop for bargains, but it will be harder to find\nones that are politically acceptable.\"\n    Japanese firms are likely to favour joint ventures or\nsmaller equity stakes in firms to avoid the political backlash\nthat blocked the Fairchild sale, analysts said. \"They\'re not\ngoing to slow up, they\'re just going to buy smaller pieces ...\nBecause of the political risk,\" said Barclays de Zoete\'s May.\n    Several Japanese firms have already taken 10 to 30 pct\nshares in smaller U.S. High technology firms such as super\nminicomputer makers, he said.\n    Opposition of the sort that blocked Fujitsu could end up\nharming U.S. Firms and undermining a trend toward multinational\ntie-ups, some analysts said.\n

Some\n10 pct of that area which gives low yields could be switched to\nmore profitable crops such as oilseeds.\n    The aim is to concentrate on raising yields from the\ncurrent 1.8 to 1.9 tonnes per ha to at least 2.5 tonnes per ha\nover the next five to seven years, he said.\n    Aziz said the current 1986/87 crop, harvesting of which is\njust beginning, is expected to yield around a record 14.5 mln\ntonnes.
